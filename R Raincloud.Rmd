This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "grey92") +
  ## use either geom_point() or geom_jitter()
  geom_point(
    ## draw bigger points
    size = 2,
    ## add some transparency
    alpha = .3,
    ## add some jittering
    position = position_jitter(
      ## control randomness and range of jitter
      seed = 1, width = .2
    )
  )
```
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "grey92")
```
```{r}
library(ggdist)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) + 
  ## add half-violin from {ggdist} package
  ggdist::stat_halfeye(
    ## custom bandwidth
    adjust = .5, 
    ## adjust height
    width = .6, 
    ## move geom to the right
    justification = -0.9, 
    ## remove slab interval
    .width = 0, 
    point_colour = NA
  ) + 
 
  ## add dot plots from {ggdist} package
  ggdist::stat_dots(
    ## orientation to the left
    side = "bottom", 
    ## move geom to the left
    justification = 0.5, 
    ## adjust grouping (binning) of observations 
    binwidth = .25
  ) + 
  ## remove white space on the left
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.2, NA))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
